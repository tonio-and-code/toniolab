                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Alright, so we're finally doin' this. Donovan to the Mariners. It's official, and I got a very special guest tonight -- Kai, who's been watchin' this team since, like, the Ichiro days, right?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Yeah, hey, thanks for havin' me on, man. This is actually my first time doin' anythin' like this, so I might be a little rough around the edges, but I'm just -- I'm so pumped about this team right now, I gotta talk about it." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: No, you're good, you're good. So tell me -- how'd you even get into baseball? 'Cause for me it was literally a video game, which is, you know, kinda embarrassing to admit." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: So mine's actually kind of a funny story. Back in 2001, Japan was just startin' to get BS digital broadcasts, and my family got a new TV right when Ichiro went to the Majors. So it was like -- the timing was perfect, you know? I'm sittin' there as a kid, watchin' this Japanese guy just absolutely destroyin' American League pitching, and I'm like, THIS is what baseball is?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: That's wild. 'Cause 2001 Seattle was somethin' else entirely." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Dude. A hundred and sixteen wins. I mean, even now, nobody's come close to that. And the thing is, they'd just lost Griffey and A-Rod, so everyone thought they were gonna fall apart, and then Ichiro shows up and they just -- they won EVERYTHING." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Bret Boone, Olerud, Edgar at DH... that lineup was stacked." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Exactly. And for a kid in Japan who'd only seen, like, Nippon Pro Baseball on regular TV, the whole vibe was completely different. The fielding was so much more dynamic -- guys barehandin' grounders at third, doin' jump throws from short -- and then the atmosphere, right? In Japan it's all organized chantin' and trumpets, but in the Majors everyone's just drinkin' beer and doin' whatever they want." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Ha, yeah. The American way." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: And the broadcasters! I didn't even speak English, but I'd hear 'See ya!' and 'Goodbye, baseball!' and 'Holy smokes!' and I just thought it was the coolest thing ever. So yeah, that 2001 team -- that's what made me a Mariners fan for life." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: And then you suffered for twenty years." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Oh, don't even get me started. Twenty-plus years without a title. There was that stretch where the front office just completely destroyed everything -- top to bottom, the whole system was a mess. You learn a different kind of patience bein' a Mariners fan." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: See, I complain when the Cards go three or four years without contentin'. You guys are built different." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: We really are. But honestly? Last year, gettin' to the ALCS, winnin' the division for the first time in forever -- I genuinely thought I might cry. And now they go out and get Donovan, and it's like, OK, this is real. This is actually happenin'." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: So let's talk about it. This trade. From the Cards side, I'm givin' it a hundred and twenty points out of a hundred. We got Seinche, Ty Pete, two draft picks -- for a guy with two years of control? That's a haul." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Yeah, so here's the thing -- I'd put it at about eighty for us. Which I know sounds lower than what the local fans are sayin'. The American Mariners fans are mostly ecstatic, like full-on celebration mode. But from where I'm sittin', the price was heavy. Especially Williamson." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Interesting. So the Japanese and American fanbases are splittin' on this?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Big time. The American side is like, 'We got our guy, let's GO.' But the Japanese side is more like, 'OK cool, but did we overpay?' And honestly, I think the Japanese fans might have a point. Williamson was a real prospect." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Yeah, but I mean -- your window is NOW. Gilbert's got two years left. The A's are buildin' fast. You can't just sit there and hope." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: No, and that's exactly why I'm still givin' it eighty and not, like, sixty. The timing was right. We HAD to make a move. I just wish they could've gotten Jojo Romero thrown in or somethin', you know? Like, if you're already payin' that much, squeeze a reliever out of it." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: That's fair. I gotta say though, from our end? Chaim played this perfectly. He held firm for months -- didn't blink. There were points where I honestly thought the whole thing was dead." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Same. Around mid-January I was like, alright, Donovan's stayin' put. We're probably gonna end up with some mid-tier guy like Urena or Andujar. And then Dipoto made that comment at the fan fest -- 'Someone's comin' soon who hasn't put on the uniform yet' -- and I knew. I just knew." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: And two days later, boom. Done deal." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Two days later it's official, and I'm refreshin' Twitter every thirty seconds tryin' to find out what the return is, 'cause they announced the trade but didn't say who was goin' back. And I'm sittin' there thinkin' -- please tell me Chaim didn't fold. Please tell me he didn't sell cheap after holdin' out that long." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: And he didn't. Man got exactly what he wanted." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Look, it hurt. Seinche plus Williamson plus Ty Pete plus the picks -- that's a LOT. But it's not fatal. We kept Montesdeoca, we kept Arroyo, and that's what matters long-term." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: The fact that you even had to worry about losin' Montesdeoca tells you how hard Chaim was pushin'. I genuinely think he was goin' for both Seinche AND Montesdeoca at one point." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Oh, I'm convinced of it. I was checkin' Trade Rumors first thing every mornin' just to make sure Montesdeoca was still ours. Couldn't start my day without confirmin' that." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Ha! That's dedication right there. Alright, we got a lot more to dig into -- the roster, the fit, the prospects. But I think we can both agree: this was one of those trades where all three teams actually walked away feelin' pretty good about it." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: For now, yeah. Check back in three years and we'll see who's really laughin'." },

                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: 俺なんかカーズが3、4年低迷しただけで文句言ってるからな。お前ら別次元だわ。" },

                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: こっちは80点くらいかな。現地ファンより低いのは分かってる。アメリカのマリナーズファンは大歓喜、完全にお祝いモードなんだけど、俺的には対価が重かった。特にウィリアムソン。" },

                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: かなりね。アメリカ側は「欲しい選手取れた、行くぞ！」だけど、日本側は「でも出しすぎじゃない？」って。正直、日本のファンの方が正しいかもしれない。ウィリアムソンは本物のプロスペクトだった。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: でもさ、勝負は今でしょ。ギルバートはあと2年。アスレチックスも着々と戦力整えてる。座って待ってるだけじゃダメだろ。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: そう、だから80点であって60点じゃないんだよ。タイミングは正しかった。動くしかなかった。ただ、これだけ出すならジョジョ・ロメロくらい付けてくれてもよかったんじゃないかって。リリーバー1枚くらいさ。" },

            english: [
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Alright, so we talked about the Donovan deal, but let's zoom out. How would you grade the whole offseason? 'Cause from the outside lookin' in, I thought they had a pretty solid winter." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: I'd give it a B-plus. Which -- I know, sounds kinda harsh. But lemme break it down, 'cause there's some really good moves in there and then there's some stuff that's still buggin' me." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Hit me. What's the highlight?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Naylor's extension. No contest. They locked him up before the Winter Meetings even started, and if they'd dragged that out, it would've cost way more. That was an S-tier move, honestly. Got it done early, got it done cheap, and now he's part of the core for years." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Smart. Get the deal done before the market inflates. What about the Ferrell pickup?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Ferrell's like a B, B-plus. He's better than I initially thought -- I was skeptical at first. But they gave up Harry Ford, who was a top-hundred guy, and that's a lot to pay for a reliever. Like, the acquisition itself makes sense, the bullpen needed help, but the price was steep for a setup man." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: And Lefsnyder? I was kinda surprised they went that direction." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: So Lefsnyder addresses a real need -- the left-handed bat thing. But here's my problem. They now have, like, FOUR guys who can play the outfield corners, and only two spots. You got Lefsnyder, Victor Robles, Dominic Canzone, and Luke Raley. Two of 'em gotta sit on the bench every night, and when you factor in the backup catcher, you've only got room for one utility infielder. The roster gets real tight." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Oh, that IS a jam. So it's almost like they need to move somebody." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Exactly what I've been sayin'. If they could flip Raley -- whose trade value isn't great right now, I get that -- but if they could package him for a middle reliever, that would solve two problems at once. Clear the outfield logjam AND add bullpen depth." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Speakin' of depth -- what's the pitching situation lookin' like? 'Cause I know Evans went down with Tommy John." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Yeah, that's where I start gettin' nervous. Evans was supposed to be the sixth starter option, and now he's done for the year. Behind the main five, there's basically just Hancock and some minor-league contracts -- Dunning, Criswell -- and honestly, none of those guys inspire a ton of confidence." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Remember last year, early on, when Gilbert and Kirby and Bryce Miller all went down at the same time?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Don't remind me. They were rollin' out KC Lawrence and some guy named Castillo -- not THAT Castillo -- just patchworkin' the rotation together. And somehow they survived it, but that's not a plan. If that happens again this year with even LESS depth? That's scary." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: What about pickin' someone up? Nick Martinez seems like a perfect fit -- can start, can relieve, super versatile." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: He's the dream pickup. But we've probably got like five million left in the budget, and Martinez is gonna cost more than that. Sugano's another name -- if he'd take a split contract, he'd actually be a solid option. But yeah, the money's tight." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: And the bullpen? Beyond the depth issue." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: So the front end is fine -- Munoz closin', Brash settin' up, Ferrell in there. But Bazzard threw seventy-eight innings last year, which is insane for a reliever, and now he's been called up for the WBC on top of that. History tells you that overworked relievers break down. Brash did it, Topa did it. I'm half expectin' Bazzard to miss time this year." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: So you're basically sayin' the ceiling is really high, but the floor could be ugly if guys start gettin' hurt." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: That's exactly it. When everyone's healthy, this lineup is better than last year's. Naylor instead of Tellez at first, Young instead of Bliss at second, Donovan instead of Polanco at third -- that's three massive upgrades. We won the division LAST year with a worse roster. So I'm not worried about the talent. I'm worried about the depth behind the talent." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: And that's why it's a B-plus and not an A." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: If they go grab one more arm before Opening Day -- even just a dependable middle reliever -- I'd bump it to an A. The bones are there. Just need a little more insurance." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: What about the rest of the division? 'Cause the AL West isn't exactly a cakewalk." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Houston's still Houston -- if Alvarez stays healthy they're dangerous. Rangers got McKenzie and if deGrom comes back, plus Yordano, that rotation's filthy. The A's? Their lineup scares me. Top to bottom, that offense might be top-five in the league, and their new park is tiny. Our pitchers throw a lot of fastballs and those guys will make you pay." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: And the Angels?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Actually, they're doin' somethin' interesting for once. Instead of the usual 'spend money, try to win now' thing, they're takin' lottery tickets -- Grayson Rodriguez, Alex Manoah -- guys who could be elite if they bounce back. If those guys hit, they'll flip 'em at the deadline for real prospects. It's the first time I've seen Moreno's team actually rebuild smart." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Which means in two or three years, they could be a real problem." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Exactly. So yeah, the window's open for Seattle right now, but it won't stay open forever. Gotta make it count while we can." },

                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: まさにそう。レイリーを出して -- トレードバリューは今低いけど -- ミドルリリーバーと交換できれば一石二鳥。外野の渋滞も解消、ブルペンの厚みも増す。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: デプスの話で言うと、投手陣はどう？エヴァンスがトミー・ジョンで離脱したよね。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: そこが不安なんだよ。エヴァンスは6番手先発の予定だったのに今季絶望。メインの5人の後ろにはハンコックとマイナー契約組しかいない。ダニング、クリスウェル -- 正直どれも心強くない。" },

                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: 思い出させないで。KCローレンスとか謎のカスティーヨとか引っ張り出してギリギリ回してた。何とか生き延びたけど、あれは計画じゃない。デプスがさらに薄い今年にあれが起きたら？怖すぎる。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: 誰か取れないの？ニック・マルティネスとか完璧にフィットしそうだけど。先発もリリーフもできて万能。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: 理想の補強だよ。でも残り予算が500万ドルくらいで、マルティネスにはそれじゃ足りない。菅野もスプリット契約なら面白いけど。とにかく予算が厳しい。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: ブルペンは？デプス以外の問題は。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: 前の方は大丈夫 -- ムニョスがクローザー、ブラッシュがセットアップ、フェレールもいる。でもバザードが去年78イニング投げてて、しかもWBCにも招集された。酷使されたリリーバーは壊れるんだよ。ブラッシュもトーパもそうだった。バザード今年離脱しても驚かない。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: つまり天井は高いけど、怪我人が出たら床が抜ける可能性があると。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: まさにそれ。全員健康なら去年よりラインナップは上。テレーズ→ネイラー、ブリス→ヤング、ポランコ→ドノバン -- 3つの大幅アップグレード。去年もっと弱いロースターで地区優勝してるからね。才能は心配してない。才能の後ろの層が心配。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: だからB+であってAじゃないと。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: 開幕前にもう1枚投手を取ってくれれば -- 信頼できるミドルリリーバーでいい -- Aに上げる。骨組みはできてる。あとはちょっとした保険だけ。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: 地区の他のチームは？ア・リーグ西は楽じゃないでしょ。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: ヒューストンは相変わらず -- アルバレスが健康なら怖い。レンジャーズはマッケンジー獲得で、デグロム復帰したらあのローテは凶悪。アスレチックスは？打線が怖い。リーグでもトップ5クラスの攻撃力で、新球場も狭い。うちの投手はストレートが多いから痛い目に遭いそう。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: エンゼルスは？" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: 実は珍しく面白い動きしてる。いつもの「金使って今勝つ」じゃなくて、宝くじ枠 -- グレイソン・ロドリゲス、アレックス・マノア -- 復活したらデカい選手を集めてる。当たったらデッドラインで売って本物のプロスペクトに変える。モレノのチームがまともに再建するの初めて見た。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: ってことは2、3年後には本当の脅威になるかも。" },

            english: [
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: OK so let's talk about the actual player. 'Cause I've been watchin' Donovan for three years now, and I genuinely think Seattle has no idea how good this guy is gonna be for them." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: So the first thing I gotta ask you -- and this is huge for us -- he's a legit leadoff option, right? 'Cause we have been STRUGGLIN' to find a leadoff guy." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Dude, he's PERFECT for it. That was literally his most common spot in St. Louis. He's hittin' around .280 with a .360 on-base, and the thing is, he's not a flashy guy -- he just gets on base. Over and over and over. He's like a metronome." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: See, that's exactly what we need. JP Crawford was battin' leadoff for a while, but he fell off last year and dropped down in the order. Then they tried Arozarena at one, and his numbers just cratered -- he's a five-hole hitter, not a table setter. And Julio's too much of a power threat to waste at the top." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: So what does the ideal lineup look like?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Donovan one, Royce Lewis two, Julio three, Naylor four, Arozarena five. That top five is NASTY. And Donovan doesn't clog up the pathway for our young guys, which is the other huge thing. Emerson and Young need at-bats at second and third, and Donovan can just slide around wherever there's a hole." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: That's the Zobrist comp I keep hearin'. Attack-mode utility player who can actually hit." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Right, and his WRC-plus has been around 120 every year. That's not just a utility guy -- that's a GOOD hitter who happens to play everywhere. He's hittin' fifteen homers, a bunch of doubles, walkin' a ton. He's not powerless, either -- people underestimate that part of his game." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Now here's the big question mark that nobody can answer yet -- T-Mobile Park. 'Cause that place has broken hitters before." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Yeah, this is the one thing I genuinely don't know. Teoscar said the batter's eye was messed up, and his numbers tanked there. But here's the thing -- there was an analysis piece that said the type of hitter who does WELL at T-Mobile is someone who sprays the ball to all fields and hits a lot of line drives. Basically, you want a gap-to-gap guy, not a pull-heavy slugger." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: And that's literally Donovan's profile." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Exactly! If you look at his spray chart, he's consistently hittin' to all fields. Line drives, doubles in the gap -- that's his bread and butter. Naylor LOVES T-Mobile, said it's super easy to hit there. Trout destroys it. But Julio struggles. So it's really a player-by-player thing, and Donovan's skillset lines up perfectly." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: What about the health stuff? 'Cause he had that sports hernia surgery in October." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Yeah, so I looked into this -- the St. Louis Dispatch had a report from Goold sayin' he's fully back in off-season training, recovery's been smooth, should be fine for spring training. And honestly, I think the surgery might actually HELP him. He'd been dealin' with chronic lower back pain for a while, and 2024 was the only year he played over 130 games. If this fixes the root cause, his availability might actually go UP." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: That tracks. Polanco had the same thing -- played through knee pain, got surgery, and then had a monster 2025." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Yep. So I'm cautiously optimistic on the health front. Now, the one thing that DOES worry me a little is the left-right splits. Against righties? He's a beast -- .385 OBP, .853 OPS, 140 WRC-plus. Against lefties? That drops to .292 OBP, .614 OPS, 75 WRC-plus. That's a big gap." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Yeah, in St. Louis they didn't really platoon him 'cause they didn't have anyone better. He just played through it." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: And the problem for us is, the guys who'd split time with him -- Young and Emerson -- are both lefties. So you can't really platoon. But if they DID want to drop him in the order against lefties, Lefsnyder is absolutely disgusting against left-handed pitching -- like, .400 OBP, 159 WRC-plus. That's elite." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: And then there's the salary. Five-point-eight million. For a guy puttin' up these numbers." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: That's HUGE for a budget-conscious team like Seattle. And you know what really sold me on Donovan as a person? When he lost his arbitration case to the Cardinals -- Nootbaar won his, and Nootbaar's salary was HIGHER even though Donovan was the better player -- most guys would be salty. Donovan did an interview and was like, 'I'm not the kind of guy who's gonna let that affect me. I'm here to help the team win.' And then he went out and made the All-Star team." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: That's the kind of guy Dipoto loves. They've been big on clubhouse chemistry ever since the dark ages -- which, from what I hear, had some real toxicity issues when teams were losin'." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Oh yeah. When you're losin' that much, guys start checkin' out. Not practicin', bein' selfish. Ichiro talked about it. So now the organization really vets guys for character before they trade for 'em. Naylor's extension was partly about that -- great clubhouse guy. And Donovan fits that mold perfectly." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: He's not a rah-rah leader type, but he leads by just quietly doin' his job at an incredibly high level. Young guys see that." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: And the defense at third should be fine. He was mostly at second and left in St. Louis 'cause Arenado had third locked down, but when he DID play third, it was solid. Not spectacular, not bad -- just average. And compared to what we had last year? Polanco playin' third was a nightmare." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Plus you're bringin' in ground-ball pitchers like Ferrell. You NEED decent defense at the corners for that to work." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Exactly. And Suarez's third-base defense had really declined, which is probably why they didn't re-sign him. Donovan gives you league-average defense there while givin' you way more with the bat. It's an upgrade in every way." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: I keep tryin' to find reasons why this DOESN'T work, and I honestly can't. He's like the Cinderella fit." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: That's what I've been sayin' since November. It's harder to argue against the fit than for it. I think he's gonna do exactly what he did in St. Louis, just in a different uniform." },

                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: OK、じゃあ選手としてのドノバンを語ろう。3年間ずっと見てきたけど、シアトルはこの選手のヤバさをまだ分かってないと思う。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: まず聞きたいのは -- これめちゃくちゃ重要なんだけど -- 彼は本物のリードオフ候補だよね？俺たちずっと1番打者を探してたんだよ。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: 完璧だよ。セントルイスでも最も多い打順が1番だった。打率.280前後でOBP.360。派手じゃないけどひたすら出塁する。メトロノームみたいに。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: まさにそれが必要なんだよ。JPクロフォードが1番打ってたけど去年調子落として下位に下がった。アロザレーナを1番にしたら成績ガタ落ち -- あいつは5番の選手で、テーブルセッターじゃない。フリオは長打力ありすぎて1番はもったいない。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: 理想の打順は？" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: 1番ドノバン、2番ロイス・ルイス、3番フリオ、4番ネイラー、5番アロザレーナ。この上位5人はエグい。しかもドノバンは若手の出場機会を潰さない。エマーソンとヤングが2塁3塁でアットバット必要で、ドノバンは穴があればどこにでもスライドできる。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: ゾブリストの比較をよく聞くよね。攻撃型ユーティリティで実際に打てる選手。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: そう、WRC+は毎年120前後。ただのユーティリティじゃなくて、どこでも守れるたまたま打力もある「いい打者」。15本くらいホームラン打って、二塁打も多くて、四球も選ぶ。パワーレスでもないんだよ。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: 大きな未知数はT-Mobile Parkだよな。あの球場で壊れた打者は過去にもいる。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: そこだけは正直分からない。テオスカーはバッターズアイがおかしいって言ってた。でも分析記事によると、T-Mobileで打てるタイプは広角に打てて、ラインドライブが多い選手。プル偏重のスラッガーじゃなくて、ギャップを抜けるタイプ。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: それ完全にドノバンのプロフィールじゃん。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: そう！スプレーチャート見ても一貫して広角に打ってる。ラインドライブ、ギャップの二塁打 -- それが彼の持ち味。ネイラーはT-Mobileで打ちやすいって自分で言ってるし、トラウトも打ちまくる。でもフリオは苦戦してる。選手次第で、ドノバンのスキルセットはぴったりハマる。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: 健康面は？10月にスポーツヘルニアの手術したよね。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: 調べたけど、セントルイス・ディスパッチのグールドの記事でオフシーズントレーニングに完全復帰、回復順調、スプリングトレーニングは問題なしって。むしろ手術がプラスかも。ずっと慢性的な腰痛を抱えてて、130試合以上出たのは2024年だけ。根本原因が治れば稼働率が上がる可能性すらある。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: ポランコと同じパターンだな。膝の痛みを抱えてプレー、手術して、2025年に大爆発。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: そう。だから健康面は慎重に楽観的。気になるのは左右の成績差。右投手相手はOBP.385、OPS.853、WRC+140で化け物。でも左投手だとOBP.292、OPS.614、WRC+75まで落ちる。かなりの差。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: セントルイスでは特にプラトーンしてなかったね。彼より良い選手がいなかったから、そのまま出してた。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: うちの問題は、出場を分け合うヤングとエマーソンがどっちも左打ちなこと。プラトーンが組みづらい。ただ、対左で打順を下げるなら、レフスナイダーの対左成績がとんでもない -- OBP.400、WRC+159。化け物級。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: で、年俸。580万ドル。この成績の選手で。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: シアトルみたいな予算重視の球団にはデカい。で、人間としてのドノバンに惚れたのは年俸調停の話。カーズと調停で負けて、ヌートバーの方が給料高いって謎な状況になったのに、インタビューで「俺はそういうことで腐る選手じゃない。チームが勝つために全力を尽くす」って言って、実際にオールスターに選ばれた。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: ディポトが好きなタイプの選手だよ。暗黒時代にクラブハウスの問題があって以来、チームケミストリーをめちゃくちゃ重視してる。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: あの時代、負けが込むと選手が腐っていった。練習に身が入らない、自分勝手になる。イチローも言ってた。だから今は獲得前に人間性を徹底調査してる。ネイラーの延長もそれが大きかった。ドノバンはそこに完璧にハマる。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: 声を張り上げて引っ張るタイプじゃないけど、黙々と高いレベルで仕事をする。若手はそれを見てる。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: で、サードの守備も問題ない。セントルイスではアレナドがいたからセカンドとレフトが多かったけど、サードに入った時も破綻はなかった。特別良くも悪くもなく平均的。去年のポランコのサード守備の惨状と比べたら天国だよ。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: しかもフェレールみたいなゴロ投手を入れてるんだから、コーナーの守備はちゃんとしてないと困るよね。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: まさに。スアレスのサード守備がかなり劣化してたから再契約しなかったんだと思う。ドノバンならリーグ平均の守備で打力は段違い。全方面でアップグレード。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: フィットしない理由を探してるんだけど、正直見つからない。シンデレラフィットだよ。" },

                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: So a listener asked about Emerson -- specifically, how much the Mariners are expectin' from him in year one. And I gotta admit, I don't know a ton about the kid. Break it down for me." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: OK so honestly? Before this trade happened, I didn't even think Emerson was gonna be the Opening Day third baseman. I figured Williamson would get that spot, and Emerson would come up in June when the service-time clock was right. But the front office clearly sees somethin' different." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: What tipped you off?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Multiple articles from front-office sources sayin' Emerson is gonna get every chance from day one. And here's what's crazy -- he's only played SIX games in Triple-A. They're basically givin' him the Julio treatment -- skippin' levels because the talent is undeniable." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Julio never even played Triple-A, right? Went straight from Double-A." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Yep. Same thing with Tatis in San Diego. So when the front office is willin' to do that, they're tellin' you they think this kid is SPECIAL. And it's not just the bat -- they've been ravin' about his makeup, his mental maturity. The kid doesn't crack under pressure." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: What kind of numbers are you expectin'?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Realistially? OPS around .750, fWAR around 2.5. Which for a rookie third baseman, that's really solid. He was a first-round pick in 2023, originally a shortstop -- big frame, so people assumed he'd move to third eventually. But his defense has improved so much that there's now talk of him stickin' at short long-term." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Wait, so the plan is third base this year, then take over short when JP Crawford hits free agency?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: That's the vision. 2026 at third to get his feet wet, then 2027 onward at short as JP's successor. Some scouting services have compared him to Witt Jr., which is obviously a high ceiling, but the tools are there -- power AND contact, improving range, smooth hands." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: He sounds like your version of Wetherholt. Franchise cornerstone." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: That's exactly what he is. They're ranked right next to each other -- both top ten in baseball. And that's why the trade math works, even though we gave up a lot. Emerson was never touchable, and he shouldn't have been." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Let's talk about the three-way trade mechanics, 'cause that part's fascinating to me. How'd the Rays get involved?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: So there was a great piece by Rosenthal that broke this down. The Rays had been interested in Williamson for a WHILE -- like, way before this trade was even on the table. And the key connection is that Tampa's GM, Neander, was Chaim's colleague back when they were both in Tampa Bay." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Oh, I didn't know that." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Yeah, they go way back. And Neander has a history with the Cardinals too -- they trade with each other all the time. So my theory is, it wasn't just that the Rays swooped in at the last minute. I think Neander was actually facilitatin' the whole deal, actin' as a go-between for Seattle and St. Louis, who don't really have a trade history together." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: That's actually really interesting. 'Cause you're right -- when's the last time the Mariners and Cardinals made a deal? It's been years." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Some cash deal for O'Brien, like, forever ago. Meanwhile, we trade with Tampa every single year. So Neander knows both sides, knows what everyone wants, and can bridge the gap. The Rays have done three-way trades before -- they're good at it." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: And speakin' of front-office relationships -- tell me about the Dipoto-Angels thing, 'cause I keep hearin' about this." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Oh man, this is one of my favorite pieces of Mariners lore. Dipoto was the Angels' GM in the mid-2010s, right? And he clashed HARD with Mike Scioscia, who was the manager. Dipoto's all about analytics, Scioscia's old-school -- and Scioscia would literally throw away the data packets Dipoto put together. Just ignore 'em completely." },

Every offseason, when I'm makin' my list of potential trade targets, I cross off every Angels player immediately. It's just not happenin' as long as Dipoto and Moreno are both around." },

                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: So here's the best story about Williamson. When the Mariners drafted him in the second round in 2023, the scout called him on FaceTime to tell him he was about to be picked. And the screen was completely dark. The kid was ASLEEP. His parents were asleep. He had no idea he was even gettin' drafted on the first night." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: No way." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: He was a senior sign -- college senior, sixty-thousand dollar bonus, which is peanuts for a second-rounder. Nobody expected much. But then he rockets through the system in under two years, makes his Major League debut, and locks down the starting third-base job. His college coach said his practice ethic was unlike anyone he'd ever seen -- the guy had a 'different engine.'" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Sounds like an Ichiro comp in terms of work ethic." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: That's exactly what I thought. And his defense at third? His DRS was plus-eight last year -- better than Arenado, better than Chapman, second only to McMahon. The Mariners' scout who drafted him compared his ceiling to Arenado and Chapman. Which -- that's wild for a second-round senior sign." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: So the Rays might actually be the long-term winners of this deal." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: If Williamson develops the bat -- and he's shown gap power in the minors, he just needs to elevate more -- he could be a 3-fWAR player. And Tampa has a track record of gettin' the most out of these kinds of guys. They took Caballero from us, they turned Brody Hopkins from a nobody into a top-hundred prospect. They just... they always seem to walk away with somethin' good." },

                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Alright, last topic -- the future. And we gotta start with Seinche, 'cause this is a guy I've been trackin' since before the draft. The switch-pitcher." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: So for anyone who doesn't know -- Seinche can pitch with both arms. Which sounds like a gimmick, but it's actually not. He was originally left-handed, but started throwin' righty because his dad was a catcher and told him right-handers have an easier time behind the plate. So now the kid can throw mid-to-upper-nineties from both sides." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: I remember that video of him and Pat Venditte goin' back and forth -- both switchin' arms, nobody could figure out who was pitchin' which way. The umpire had no idea what to do." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Classic. But here's the real story: his right arm is actually WAY better than his left now. Against right-handed hitters, his splits at Double-A were ridiculous -- .480 OPS allowed, 30% strikeout rate, 3.7% walk rate. That's dominant stuff." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: And the left side?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Not great. The velocity's lower, the command's worse, and hitters were takin' him deep. So before the trade, the plan was for him to go right-arm only startin' this spring. Which I think is the right call. If he can develop a good changeup for left-handed hitters -- and his right-side changeup already has nice sink to it -- he could be a legit number-three starter." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Velo from the right side?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Sittin' low-to-mid-nineties, touchin' a hundred. He's got the arm. The question is whether he can refine the secondary stuff against lefties. If that comes together, we could see him in the Majors by the end of this year." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Now, the Cardinals are actually pretty good at developin' changeup pitchers, so maybe that's a fit." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: That's exactly what I was thinkin'. The whole 'use the left arm against lefties' strategy wasn't workin', so now it's about buildin' a real changeup from the right side. St. Louis has a track record with that. I think this is a good landing spot for him." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: OK, now the heavy stuff. Gilbert's contract situation. Listener's askin' whether the Mariners should extend him, and what happens to the rotation in two years." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: So I feel VERY strongly that they need to extend Gilbert. Three reasons. First -- he hits free agency earliest. If you lose him, you lose the anchor of the staff before anyone else. Second -- he's probably the most likely to actually AGREE to an extension. He and Cal Raleigh were drafted the same year, they came up through the minors together as battery mates, and Raleigh just signed a six-year deal. Gilbert has genuine emotional ties to this organization." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: And the third reason?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Leadership. Gilbert and Bryce Miller basically run the pitching staff's development culture. Every spring, they organize these sessions where pitchers share new grips, work on pitch development together. That environment -- that culture of constantly gettin' better -- exists because of Gilbert. When young arms like Cade Anderson and Ryan Sloan come up, they need that mentor figure." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: So what's the holdup?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Timing. Gilbert had some injuries last year, so from HIS perspective, this isn't the best time to negotiate -- he'd want another Cy Young-caliber season to maximize his value. And next year there's salary arbitration, which complicates things. So realistically, it might end up bein' a free-agency-and-re-sign situation rather than an extension." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: What does the payroll picture look like going forward?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: This is where it gets scary. In 2027, JP Crawford, Arozarena, Lefsnyder, Kizner, and Robles all come off the books -- that's like forty million freed up. Sounds great, right? But Naylor, Raleigh, Munoz, and Miller all get raises that eat up about twelve-point-five million of that. Then you've got TEN arbitration-eligible guys, includin' Gilbert and Kirby. And with the Scubal arbitration case settin' a new ceiling at thirty-two million..." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: That could push those arb numbers way up." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Exactly. Worst case, the 2027 budget for acquisitions could be as low as twenty million. Which means -- and I know this is gonna sound crazy -- they might need to trade Kirby." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Trade KIRBY?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Hear me out. If they extend Gilbert, they've locked down their ace. Kirby's got two years of control left, so his trade value is sky-high. You trade him for a major-league-ready pitching prospect, and suddenly you've got Anderson and Sloan fillin' Kirby's spot while the new guy provides another option. It's painful, but the math might force their hand." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Man, as a Cardinals fan, these are unbelievably high-class problems. Our pitching depth is... we don't talk about it." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Ha! Well, your farm is stacked now, so give it time. But yeah, my ideal future rotation would be Gilbert, Miller, Woo at the top, then Anderson, Sloan, and whoever they get from a Kirby trade fighting for the last two spots. Plus they could draft another college arm this summer -- they've got the 24th pick." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: And the international free-agent class." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Right! They've got the second and third overall picks in next year's international class. Those are position players, so the farm stays loaded even as they promote guys." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: OK, last question. This is the fiftieth anniversary season. Rick Rizzs is retiringQ -- the voice of the Mariners for decades. What are the expectations?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Division title is non-negotiable. After everything -- the twenty-year drought, the trades we made, the prospects we gave up -- anythin' less would be a failure. But honestly? I want the World Series. This is the closest this franchise has EVER been. The pitching core is elite, the lineup is deep, and for the first time in my life as a fan, I feel like we belong in that conversation." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: You really think this is the year?" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: I think the maximum output this team can produce -- if everything breaks right -- is the best it's ever been. There's no guarantee, obviously. The National League has... you know, THAT team that spent a billion dollars. And the AL's got the Red Sox, the Blue Jays, plenty of competition. But yeah. If there was ever a year for the Mariners, it's 2026." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: For what it's worth, I'm rootin' for you guys. The Cards aren't exactly appointment TV this year." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: Ha! Well, when the big-league team is struggling, watch the farm. That's how you survive twenty years of darkness. Find the next great prospect, get excited about THAT, and keep the faith." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: 'When it's bad, watch the farm.' That should be a bumper sticker." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: It's been my survival strategy for two decades. But right now? Right now I don't need survival strategies. I need October baseball. And I genuinely believe it's comin'." },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: Well, everyone go follow Kai on X -- he's got Montesdeoca and Arroyo as his profile pic, which tells you everything you need to know about his priorities. Kai, thanks for comin' on, man. This was incredible." },

                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: 知らない人のために説明すると、サインチェは両腕で投げられる。ギミックに聞こえるけど違う。元々左利きで、お父さんがキャッチャーだったから「右で投げた方が楽だ」と言われて右投げを始めた。で、今は両方で90マイル後半が出る。" },

                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: イマイチ。球速も落ちるし、コマンドも悪いし、打ち込まれてた。だからトレード前の計画は、この春から右一本に専念すること。正しい判断だと思う。左打者に対するチェンジアップを磨ければ -- 右のチェンジアップは既にいい沈みがある -- 先発3番手は十分ありえる。" },

                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: ギルバートの延長は絶対必要だと思ってる。理由は3つ。1つ目 -- FAが一番早い。彼を失ったらエースが真っ先にいなくなる。2つ目 -- 延長に応じてくれる可能性が一番高い。キャル・ローリーと同期ドラフトで、マイナー時代からバッテリーを組んできた。ローリーが6年延長したばかりだし、この組織に愛着がある。" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Marcus: 3つ目は？" },
                { speaker: 'male', text: "Kai: リーダーシップ。ギルバートとブライス・ミラーが投手陣の開発文化を作ってる。毎年キャンプで新しいグリップを共有したり、球種開発のセッションを主催してる。常に向上しようっていう空気感はギルバートがいるからこそ。ケイド・アンダーソンやライアン・スローンが上がってきた時、あのメンター的存在が必要。" },
